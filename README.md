Grabs AWS Lambda Layer information (specifically, latest version ARNs for each Layer). After adding a new version to a Layer, AWS will not update all existing Lambda functions that use that layer to point to the latest version. This results in some really annoying conflicts when trying to update layers without "un-provisioning" existing resources.
